Deep Learning course's projects using pytorch.
These are the projects from a Macine Learning course I took at the university.

Project 1: Datasets, Dataloader, Samplers, Linear Regression and Linear classifier.
Project 2: Backpropagation, Optimizers, MLP, CNN.
Project 3: Classifiers - Multilayer GRU (similar to RNN - LSTM model), Attention, Encoder and Fine tuning 'distilbert' model from HuggingFace.

** For every project there is a Jupyter notebooks for testing the code and an explanations on the implementations of the code. **
