# DL-Course
Deep Learning course's projects using pytorch.
<br>
These are the projects from a Deep Learning course I took at the university.
<br>
<br>
Project 1: Datasets, Dataloaders, Samplers, Linear Regression and Linear classifier.
<br>
Project 2: Backpropagation, Optimizers, MLP, CNN.
<br>
Project 3: Classifiers - Multilayer GRU (similar to RNN - LSTM model), Attention, Encoder and Fine tuning 'distilbert' model from HuggingFace.
<br>
<br>
** For every project there is a Jupyter notebooks for testing the code and an explanations on the implementations of the code. **
